# **html, css, & javascript**
### HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
### CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.

### JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.
**CSS**
## CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page

**JavaScript**
## JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.


# **html, css, & javascript**
**HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the languages that run the web. They’re very closely related, but they’re also designed for very specific tasks. Understanding how they interact will go a long way towards becoming a web developer. We’ll be expanding on this throughout the tutorial, but the gist of it is**
* *HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up*
* *CSS is for formatting that marked up content*
* *JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive*
